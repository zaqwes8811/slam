FadingMemoryFilter
==================

Introduction and Overview
-------------------------

Implements a polynomial fading memory filter. You can achieve the same
results, and more, using the KalmanFilter class. However, some books
use this form of the fading memory filter, so it is here for completeness.
I suppose some would also find this simpler to use than the standard
Kalman filter.
